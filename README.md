# Facial-Emotions-Detection-
Develop a system that can recognize and classify facial expressions in images .Create a facial emotion detection model capable of identifying different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc

This project aims to develop a facial expression recognition system capable of identifying different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., based on facial features. The system can process images or real-time video input and classify facial expressions using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and labeled datasets.
