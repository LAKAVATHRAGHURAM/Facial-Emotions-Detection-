# Facial-Emotions-Detection-
Develop a system that can recognize and classify facial expressions in images .Create a facial emotion detection model capable of identifying different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc

This project aims to develop a facial expression recognition system capable of identifying different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., based on facial features. The system can process images or real-time video input and classify facial expressions using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and labeled datasets.

# Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow or PyTorch
OpenCV
Other libraries as necessary

# Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the main script to start facial expression recognition:
Follow the on-screen instructions to provide input (image or video) for facial expression recognition.
View the output displaying recognized facial expressions.

# Contributing
Contributions to improve the facial expression recognition system are welcome. You can contribute by:
Adding support for new facial expressions.
Improving the accuracy and efficiency of the recognition algorithm.
Enhancing the user interface and experience.
Please follow the standard GitHub workflow for contributing: Fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
